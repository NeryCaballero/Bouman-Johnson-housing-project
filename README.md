## What
- The application estimates the value of a property based on a series of user inputs.

## How
- This application connects to an [API](https://github.com/orhannurkan/API-deployment) (built by [Orhan Nurkan](https://github.com/orhannurkan), Bouman/AI intern @ BeCode) using javascript and fetch.


## Pending things to do:
- Improve responsiveness of the interface.
- Tune in "Full address" input.
- Host on a free server.
